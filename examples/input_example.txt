I need to extend my visa before end of next month,
pay November rent and electricity bill,
clean the fridge and do laundry,
update my CV and apply for at least 3 data science jobs,
call my mom about her birthday this weekend,
book a dentist appointment sometime next week,
cancel old gym membership ASAP.
